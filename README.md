# ChiFouMi Intelligent

ChiFouMi is an application developed in [python](https://www.python.org/) which allows you to have fun playing at Rock-Paper-Scissors against a smart machine and to analyze at the end the strategies of the users for research purposes.

## Goals

The key concepts of this project are Machine Learning and Deep Learning: the machine will be an artificial intelligence capable of analyzing the strategy of the user, and it will, if possible, recognize images from the user's hand. 
The end user of the game will be able to make movements in front of the camera to play, launch his opponent (the intelligent machine), and play against the machine.

## Installation

In the folder, there is a file that allows you to install all the packages necessary to launch the application. 
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (version 3) to install the app.
The file is called "requirement.txt" and must be placed on a command terminal to be able to execute the following command :

```bash
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage

In order to launch the application
```bash
python3 Bienvenue.py
```
